# Dining API

This Dining API scrapes location data from the CMU dining sites and distributes it as a RESTful API. Access the API [here](https://apis.scottylabs.org/dining/).

To build and deploy the service, you'll need [Bun](https://bun.sh),
which you should install beforehand.

Then, clone this repository to your computer by running
```
git clone https://github.com/ScottyLabs/dining-api.git
```
after making sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) downloaded or running
```
gh repo clone ScottyLabs/dining-api
```
if you have the [Github CLI](https://cli.github.com/).

If you already have the node_modules folder or package-lock.json from previous versions of the Dining API, please remove them before continuing.

Now install the API's dependencies by 'cd'-ing into the root of the repository and running:
```
bun install
```

Then, you can run the server with ```bun start``` and it should work! You can also use 
```bun run start``` since ```bun start``` is its shorthand version. However,
if you're in ScottyLabs, make sure to talk to whomever is running Operations to
tell you the way to properly background this server so it matches everything
else.

Note: To add new dependencies, use ```bun add dependency-name```. To remove dependencies, use ```bun remove dependency-name```.
